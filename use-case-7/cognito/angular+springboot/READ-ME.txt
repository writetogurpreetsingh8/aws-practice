Project Overview:

This demo consists of two separate applications:

1) Frontend: Built with Angular
2) Backend: Built with Spring Boot

Key Features:

A) Implements Sign In, Sign Up, and Token Refresh functionality.
B) Uses OAuth 2.0 with PKCE flow, with AWS Cognito as the Identity Provider.
C) All authentication logic (Sign In, Sign Up, redirection handling) is managed by the backend.
D) Upon successful login, the frontend receives id_token, access_token, and refresh_token. It includes the access_token as a Bearer token in the Authorization header for subsequent API calls.
E) The backend is configured as an oauth2ResourceServer, which automatically extracts and validates the Bearer token to authenticate the user.
F) If the access_token expires, the backend responds with a 401 Unauthorized error. The frontend intercepts this, triggers a refresh by calling the /oauth2/token endpoint, obtains a new access_token and retries the original request.
